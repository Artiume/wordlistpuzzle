Wordlistpuzzle makes custom wordlists and saves them into a file for you.
Only works with ascii at the moment!

It needs some parameters such as:

- Lenght of the password
- Known parts of the password (if any)
- Composition of characters to make the wordlist

The resultant file (wordlist) will have all the possible forms of the password written line by line.

Usage: python3 wordlistpuzzle.py
